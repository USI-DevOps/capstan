# How to Contribute to Capstan



## Creating Issues

- Find something broken? Create a GitHub issue, after checking that the issue exists
- Did you fix something?
  - If there  is an issue make a PR that references the issue...make sure the issue describes the brokeness well.
  - If there is not an issue, thanks and just described what you fixed in your PR


## Code contributions

### Signal and Noise

*Dirty Development and Stable Master*

The latest and greatest code is always in Development. That does not mean that development always works. Master works as described in the related platform readme and release notes. Thusly, master will always (read with finger quotes) work. 

### Fork and PR

- Fork from development to get the latest and greatest code to perform fixes and additions
- Perform PR(s) against development


## Releases and Tags

How are tags and released used?

- *Releases* in Github are always based on tags on master
- Development should have the same features as master at every *release*
- Tagged releases closely correlate to master and development have some sort of code parity
