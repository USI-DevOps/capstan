# Pipelines on GCP

These pipelines are ones developed against the GCP version of Capstan or used some IaaS specific capabilities.

Unless otherwise specified, this collection of GCP pipelines build upon each other. So start with the *initial* pipelines. 

Additionally, this collection of pipelines uses the [Hello](https://github.com/kenzanlabs/hello-karyon-rxnetty) and associated Docker Hub [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nparkskenzan/hellokenzan/) to start the process. You will Fork this GitHub Repository to make the appropiate code changes.
